abstract = {In the literature on boundaries, it is sometimes falsely assumed that learning naturally evolves from a co-location of diverse practices and perspectives. Empirical studies indicate that this is not self-evident. The aim of this article is to understand the challenge of learning at the boundary. In the light of this aim, the article interprets empirical findings from two previous longitudinal studies of academic projects, in which educational scholars, with diverse cultural backgrounds and different academic perspectives, collaboratively conduct research and encounter boundaries during interaction. The case studies show that (1) boundaries that people encounter can easily stay implicit during ongoing negotiations, and (2) when people do identify boundaries and explicate them during collaborative processes, dialogical engagement is triggered. On the basis of the findings, I argue that explicitly identifying boundaries enables learning since it creates a collective need to take more into account some unfamiliar perspective or practice.},

@article{Engestrom2010,
abstract = {The paper examines studies based on the theory of expansive learning, formulated in 1987. In recent years the theory has been used in a wide variety of studies and interventions. The theory builds on foundational ideas put forward by Vygotsky, Leont’ev, Il’enkov, and Davydov, key figures in the Russian school of cultural–historical activity theory. Studies based on the theory are reviewed in six sections: expansive learning as transformation of the object, expansive learning as movement in the zone of proximal development, expansive learning as cycles of learning actions, expansive learning as boundary crossing and network building, expansive learning as distributed and discontinuous movement, and formative interventions. A separate section is devoted to critiques of expansive learning. It is concluded that the ultimate test of learning theories is how they help practitioners to generate learning that grasps pressing issues the humankind is facing. The theory of expansive learning currently expands its analyses both up and down, outward and inward. Moving up and outward, it tackles learning in fields or networks of interconnected activity systems with their partially shared and often contested objects. Moving down and inward, it tackles issues of subjectivity, experiencing, personal sense, emotion, embodiment, identity, and moral commitment.},

@article{Hussey2002,
abstract = {Recent decades have seen an increasing stress on the need to monitor and manage educators, and hold them to account. This article argues that, while learning outcomes can be valuable if properly used, they have been misappropriated and adopted widely at all levels within the education system to facilitate the managerial process. This has led to their distortion. The claim that they can be made precise by being written with a prescribed vocabulary of special descriptors so as to serve as objective, measurable devices for monitoring performance, is fundamentally mistaken, and they may be damaging to education when used in this way. After a brief sketch of the background to the notion of learning outcomes, arguments are presented to show their vacuity and uselessness when misused in this way, and explanations of their inadequacies are offered},

@article{Kerosuo2011,
abstract = {The article analyses a collaborative effort of learning across workplace boundaries in a regional learning network of South Savo, Finland. The focus is on the Forum of In-house Development in the network. Our objective is to highlight a dialectical approach to boundaries that draws from the ideas of cultural–historical activity theory. Expansive transformation may be explored through the expansion of socio-spatial and instrumental-developmental boundaries. This is shown through four transitional episodes that reveal the expansion of the object of learning. We argue that crossing the socio-spatial boundary of a workplace is not a sufficient condition, but that new meditational means created at the instrumental-developmental boundary are needed to expand workplace learning and development in challenging and complex regional contexts.},

@article{Penuel2014,
abstract = {This article focuses on emerging forms of formative intervention research in educational settings in the United States. The examples presented in the article share three key features with cultural-histor- ical activity theory (CHAT) formative intervention research: (a) a focus on historically accumulating structural tensions within and across activity systems, (b) use of double-stimulation as a method of intervention, and (c) expanding agency as the object of intervention. The examples differ from CHAT approaches, however, in that they employ mediating devices from research on how children develop understanding of core ideas in traditional subject-matter disciplines and from theories developed by sociologists of education and policy researchers in education. In presenting these examples as forma- tive intervention research, I aim to renew dialogue between CHAT researchers and learning scientists about design experimentation within and across activity systems. 5 10 Q1 EX},

@article{Sheehan2012,
abstract = {The purpose of this research was to probe the philosophical beliefs of instructional designers using sound philosophical constructs and quantitative data collection and analysis. We investigated the philosophical and methodological beliefs of instructional designers, including 152 instructional design faculty members and 118 non-faculty professionals. We used the Philosophy of Social Science Inventory, a 52-item questionnaire, to measure 20 beliefs within four categories. We probed four ontological beliefs (ontological realism, ontological relativism, physicalism, and idealism); five epistemological beliefs (epistemological relativism, fallibilism, epistemological objectivity, rationalism, and empiricism); three axiological beliefs (ethical realism, ethical relativism, and valueneutrality in research); and eight methodological beliefs (nomothetic, idiographic and critical methods, scientific naturalism, humanism, and quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods). Our research questions included (a) What are the predominant philosophical and methodological beliefs of instructional designers? (b) Do instructional design faculty and non-faculty instructional designers, identifying with different research methodologies, hold different sets of philosophical beliefs? and (c) What relationships exist between philosophical beliefs and age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, and/or years of service? Overall, the philosophical profile of instructional designers can reasonably be described as pragmatic. Belief characterizations of methodological subgroups (e.g., those identifying with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods research) generally supported our hypotheses. Although demographic variables (except gender) were not singularly important, our analyses suggest that a combination of ethnicity, gender, research preference, and level of education can be used to predict philosophical and methodological beliefs.},
